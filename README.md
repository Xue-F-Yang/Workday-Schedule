# Workday-Schedule

Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple app designed to help you organize your workday schedule. It is divided into two sections: the header and the time sections. The header consists of the title of the site and provides today's date in (Weekday, Month Day) format. The time section consists of 9-hour blocks from 9 AM to 5 PM representing a normal workday.

The blocks' formatting will change depending on the time of day with grey, red, and green blocks representing past, present, and future respectively. The text area can be updated, and the inputted text saved to the local drive by clicking the save button on the right side of the block. At 12 AM, the saved events will be cleared out of the local drive to allow for events to be scheduled for the new day.
